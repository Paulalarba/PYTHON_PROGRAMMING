    "Critique\n",
    "• Correctness:\n",
    "The code correctly reads two numbers from user input, converts them to floats, and calculates the exponent. It handles basic input errors using try/except blocks and provides clear error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Complexity:\n",
    "The function runs in O(1) time complexity for the calculation itself. The input operations are constant time, making the overall program efficient for its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Robustness:\n",
    "It handles ValueError exceptions for non-numeric inputs and catches other unexpected errors. However, it doesn't handle empty inputs, very large numbers that might cause overflow, or mathematical edge cases like 0^0. The program exits after one calculation instead of allowing multiple operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Readability:\n",
    "The code is clean and well-structured with clear variable names and helpful comments. The user interface is straightforward with descriptive prompts. It could benefit from a docstring for the main function and more specific error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Faithfulness:\n",
    "It demonstrates proper exception handling as taught, using try/except blocks for input validation. However, it doesn't show the comparison with str.isdigit() or explain why pre-validation methods are insufficient for full number validation."

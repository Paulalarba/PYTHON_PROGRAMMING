    "Critique\n",
    "• Correctness:\n",
    "The code correctly simulates two fair dice rolls and calculates the empirical probability of rolling a sum of 7. The exact probability calculation (6/36) is mathematically accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Complexity:\n",
    "The function runs in O(n) time complexity for n simulations, which is optimal for Monte Carlo simulations. The space complexity is O(1) since it only stores a counter and running total.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Robustness:\n",
    "The code handles the basic simulation correctly but lacks error handling for edge cases. It doesn't validate that the number of simulations is positive, and there's no protection against extremely large simulation counts that could cause performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Readability:\n",
    "The code is well-structured with clear variable names and helpful comments. The use of 100_000 with underscores improves number readability. The output is informative but could better highlight the comparison between empirical and exact results.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Faithfulness:\n",
    "The implementation faithfully follows Monte Carlo simulation principles using the random module. The comments about seeding and reproducibility appropriately address the anchor concepts."

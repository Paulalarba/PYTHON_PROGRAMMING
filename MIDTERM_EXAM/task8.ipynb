    "\"\"\"• Correctness:\n",
    "The code correctly implements the composition relationship between Kennel and Dog classes, with all required methods functioning as specified. \n",
    "The Dog class has the proper attributes and bark method, and the Kennel class successfully manages a collection of Dog instances with add, remove, find oldest, and breed search functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Complexity:\n",
    "The Kennel methods have varying time complexities: add_dog and remove_dog are O(1) and O(n) respectively, oldest_dog is O(n) for scanning all dogs, and find_by_breed is O(n) for filtering. \n",
    "Space complexity is O(n) for storing the dog collection, which is appropriate for this use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Robustness:\n",
    "The code includes basic type checking in add_dog and error handling in remove_dog, but lacks comprehensive input validation. It doesn't handle duplicate dogs, \n",
    "negative ages, empty names, or invalid breed inputs. The case-insensitive breed search is a good robustness feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Readability:\n",
    "The code is well-structured with clear docstrings and descriptive method names. Variable names are appropriate and follow PEP 8 conventions.\n",
    " The test script effectively demonstrates the functionality, though it could benefit from more edge case testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Faithfulness:\n",
    "The implementation faithfully uses composition (Kennel has Dogs) rather than inheritance, which is correct since a kennel is not a type of dog but rather contains dogs.\n",
    " This demonstrates proper OOP design principles for managing collections of objects through composition.\"\"\""

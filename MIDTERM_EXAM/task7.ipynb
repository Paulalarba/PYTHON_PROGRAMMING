    "• Correctness:\n",
    "The code correctly implements the OOP structure with inheritance and method overriding, properly handling fuel consumption and mileage tracking. \n",
    "The Truck class successfully overrides the default fuel efficiency, and all vehicle operations work as specified in the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Complexity:\n",
    "All methods run in O(1) time complexity with constant space requirements, which is optimal for vehicle operations. \n",
    "The inheritance structure doesn't add computational overhead beyond the basic attribute access and method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Robustness:\n",
    "The code handles basic operations well, but lacks input validation for negative values and invalid data types. \n",
    "It doesn't prevent over-filling during refuel or handle edge cases like extremely large distance values that could cause calculation issues. \n",
    "Missing validation could lead to an inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Readability:\n",
    "The code has excellent documentation with clear docstrings and type hints. Variable names are descriptive and follow PEP 8 conventions. \n",
    "The test script demonstrates functionality clearly and the use of inheritance is well-explained through class structure and comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Faithfulness:\n",
    "It follows the lessons on object-oriented programming in Lesson 6,\n",
    "demonstrating inheritance, method overriding, and class hierarchy as taught.\n",
    "It correctly applies code reuse through inheritance and shows specialization via method overrides, aligning with the anchor concepts.\n",
